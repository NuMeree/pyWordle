# pyWordle
Its wordle but in python
It's like the classic wordle however it's in the terminal and you don't need to type an actual word for it to count or you don't need to worry about how many tries you have.
--Instructions--
1.After downloading right click on the folder and select "Open in terminal"
2.Write "py wordle.py" and then you are good to start!

It's a little project I made I hope you like it!
